&lt;p&gt;In June, members of the American Red Cross GIS team traveled to Hoi An, Viet Nam for a Missing Maps training with the Viet Nam Red Cross Society (VNRC) and the American Red Cross Viet Nam Delegation. The purpose of the training was twofold: (1) to train Red Cross staff on how to conduct community mapping, with a focus on mobile data collection, and (2) to demonstrate how to use open-source GIS platforms to produce maps, with the objective of improving preparedness for natural disasters. Using a training of trainers model, participants – and future trainers – learn best practices for conducting community mapping projects in medium- to large-scale teams and how to help their mappers succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;annual-flooding-in-central-viet-nam&quot;&gt;Annual Flooding in Central Viet Nam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, Central Viet Nam is affected by several major flood events. In recent a recent assessment, The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://unosat-maps.web.cern.ch/unosat-maps/VN/FL20171106VNM/UNOSAT_A3_FL20171106VNM_QuangNam_Portrait.pdf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; that analyzed how many people were  affected by floodwaters in this coastal area following tropical cyclone DAMREY-17 (highlighted in red).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;UNITAR Viet Nam Quang Nam Province, Photo: UNITAR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flood analysis indicates that approximately 190,000 people were affected by Cyclone DAMREY-17 in Quang Nam Province. Having access to maps like these and being able to analysis how far residents live from coastal fronts allow community planners and the VNRC to prepare flood strategies and mitigate large impacts from major storm surges and landslides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-open-source-mapping-tools-to-plan-for-flooding-in-vulnerable-areas&quot;&gt;Using open source mapping tools to plan for flooding in vulnerable areas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way the VNRC prepares for annual flood events is by routinely completing Vulnerability Capacity Assessments (VCAs). These were traditionally done by hand, making results hard to share and refer back to.  When the teams incorporate OpenStreetMap (OSM) into a workflow to complete the VCA, this can result in a more detailed and accurate spatial layout of communities. We can use OSM data layers (like historic flood levels, transportation routes, population densities, etc.) to enhance VCAs so they are more informative to decision-makers. Additionally, understanding where communities are most vulnerable allows us to identify and resolve gaps in our data, ensuring that future plans improve over time. Lastly, using OSM allows us to digitize our results and share the data we created with the wider community for further discussions and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-week-of-mobile-data-collection--community-mapping-practice&quot;&gt;A Week of Mobile Data Collection &amp;amp; Community Mapping Practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Remote Mapping&lt;/strong&gt;
Topic: Introduction to Missing Maps and OpenStreetMap
Activity: Remote mapping and validation practice
Goal: Understand best practices for community mapping&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Plan&lt;/strong&gt;
Topic: Utilizing Field Papers for effective planning
Activity: Plan for groups to conduct mobile data collection, gathering points-of-interests in the community and upload data into OSM
Goal: Learn how to effectively plan and conduct mobile data collection in teams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Execute&lt;/strong&gt;
Topic: Using open source tools for mobile data collection
Activity: Collect data using Maps.me
Goal: Combine everything learned from Day 1 and 2 and collect Points of Interest (POIs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Analyze&lt;/strong&gt;
Topic: Integrating open data and conducting a Vulnerability and Capacity Assessment
Activity: Participants create VCAs using the OSM base layer to inform where there are heavy residential areas and major POIs that are valuable during a storm surge
Goal: Integrate data created through mobile data collection with pre-existing data in OSM to help inform the VCA and ultimately improve preparedness plans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Implement&lt;/strong&gt;
Topic: Map production 
Activity: Learn how to use Overpass Turbo to extract mapping data and QGIS to produce maps
Goal: Create individual maps from VCAs, complete with traditional mapping markers (including a title, north arrow, and legend)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-away-points&quot;&gt;Take away points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the training, participants are able to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explore data in OSM and “validate” data if it was incorrect or poorly drawn&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collect missing data on their own, combining two tools: Field Papers and Maps.me&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scan their field maps into a digital format and draw their vulnerable community layers on top, indicating where neighborhoods or areas are most vulnerable to major floods and storm surges&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take their new strategies learned and data collected into QGIS to produce a professional map that can be used in meetings with partners and stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly two years after the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapswipe.org/index.html&quot;&gt;MapSwipe app&lt;/a&gt; in July 2016, a massive 23,828 people have swiped through its satellite imagery, identifying squares containing buildings and/or roads. Together they’ve swiped 495,135 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - that’s very nearly the size of Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MapSwipers are a truly international bunch, hailing as much from Tanzania, Denmark, Singapore or the Czech Republic as from the US and UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is being maintained by an equally international bunch of volunteers and staff from the Missing Maps community. And thanks to the hard work of volunteers, the MapSwipe app is now open source, so anyone with the relevant coding skills can access the code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapswipe/mapswipe&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and help to improve the app. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5-LIScH0URlymhTzXAyrbTJUEMmfBvWfBVuW38Zw9PnxPzA/viewform&quot;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested - particularly if you have React Native, Python, Firebase or general mobile app development skills!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-happens-to-mapswipe-data&quot;&gt;So what happens to MapSwipe data?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re lounging on the sofa swiping serenely over a remote part of the planet, it can be difficult to imagine how the data you’re producing is being used or who it’s helping. So I talked to Nell Gray, a qualitative research officer at MSF, about how they’re using MapSwipe data in a project in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015 MSF opened the Pran Men’m (“Take My Hand”) clinic, which provides medical, psychological and social care for survivors of sexual violence. Nell explains: “Services available for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, especially for minors, aren’t sufficient in Port-au-Prince.” Between May 2015 and Dec 2017 the clinic treated nearly 2,000 survivors, mostly women and girls, and 58% were minors (under 18). It was moving to hear Nell talk about the project; you can read stories &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msf.org/en/article/photo-story-haiti-against-their-will&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; from some of the women and girls who have used the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a hugely capable and professional team providing care 24 hours a day to anybody who needs it, often in quite difficult cases. I was just really impressed by them and the work that they’re doing and the huge impact you can have on the lives of people experiencing sexual violence.” Rape survivors should be seen within 72 hours in order to receive effective HIV prevention and emergency contraception. Abortion is illegal in Haiti and although following intensive efforts HIV rates are falling they are still some of the highest outside Africa so the stakes are high for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nell explained that in a large capital city one clinic isn’t accessible to everyone, so there are several outreach sites and MSF are currently carrying out a household survey to look at how they can increase access to services, particularly within the 72 hour window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20180625_banner_port-au-prince.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Parts of Port-au-Prince are densely populated, Photo: Benedicte Kurzen/Noor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We needed to pick random points to do the household survey to ensure the coverage of the survey is good. But the problem with Port-au-Prince is that some places are super densely populated and in some places you could drop a point and there’s no houses there at all. So we were grappling with how to manage that and it was at this point that somebody suggested MapSwipe. Within a couple of days it was done and the field team were super impressed and very happy at being able to work with that data rather than just a blank map of the city effectively.” You can see the MapSwipe data for the Haiti project &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapswipe.heigit.org/analytics/?id=13515&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re not asking about personal experiences or collecting information about incidence of sexual violence, it’s much more about understanding barriers to accessing care or support and how they can be overcome… There is often a question of whether it’s a knowledge issue, so that people aren’t aware that it’s a medical emergency for example or that there are health services available. Do people know about the 72 hour window? Or do they know that and it’s other barriers that stop them coming?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey is also looking at whether particular groups of people or areas are more vulnerable. Because some of the factors may be geographical, having a good geographical starting point is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the survey will help MSF carry out a participatory design process with local residents on improving access to services. “That could be anything from different health promotion strategies, different communication messages, different ways of communicating with people, to having services in different places and it would really help us to understand if knowledge is particularly low in an area and we need to focus awareness raising there, or if there are areas where services are particularly inaccessible where maybe we need to work with the Ministry of Health to build capacity in a hospital for example.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;want-to-dig-deeper-into-maps-and-data&quot;&gt;Want to dig deeper into maps and data?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Haiti project used MapSwipe data directly. But on many projects - and this was its original purpose - MapSwipe is the first stage in preparing more detailed maps as it hugely cuts down the amount of time mappers have to spend scrolling through empty forest and scrub. Detailed mapping is mostly done by volunteers and anyone can get involved - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/learn/&quot;&gt;find out how here&lt;/a&gt;. There may be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/events/&quot;&gt;mapathon in your area&lt;/a&gt; you can go along to to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be interested in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapswipe.heigit.org/home/&quot;&gt;MapSwipe Analytics website&lt;/a&gt;, produced by the Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology. Here you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapswipe.heigit.org/analytics/&quot;&gt;see the data visualised&lt;/a&gt; on a map or against the satellite imagery, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapswipe.heigit.org/processing/&quot;&gt;download it&lt;/a&gt; to explore it yourself, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapswipe.heigit.org/live/&quot;&gt;watch results being submitted in real time&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapswipe.heigit.org/tutorial/&quot;&gt;work through a tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking to humanitarian professionals revealed it was important to make the data as open and available as possible so anyone can refer to it when needed, without specialist equipment. So if you look at a project online you can see at a glance where the areas of likely population are. That could be pretty useful in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20180625_haiti-data.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Part of the Haiti project as visualised on the MapSwipe Analytics website: green areas have been marked by MapSwipe users as populated, yet you can see these buildings are not on the base map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing question whether machine learning could replace MapSwipe, but so far the answer is “not yet”. Researchers at Heidelberg have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/deepvgi_en.html&quot;&gt;recently made significant progress&lt;/a&gt; but building styles and landscape appearance can vary hugely between different areas so there isn’t a one off solution. MapSwipe data makes great training data sets for these experiments though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-next-for-the-app&quot;&gt;So what next for the app?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the code is open source there’s more opportunity to improve the app and we’ve been keeping an eye on feedback. For instance, lots of people have asked for the zoom function to be more stable, and for it to be clearer what scale the imagery is, so hopefully we can tackle some of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about MapSwipe 2.0? How could the app take a whole leap forward? One suggestion is that it could be used for a complete mapping process - I knocked up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://marvelapp.com/5dbh3bb/screen/36773653&quot;&gt;quick prototype&lt;/a&gt; for this idea.  Or should the user be able to indicate how many buildings are in a square, to give a better idea of population density? Or could MapSwipe be used to indicate where OpenStreetMap and the satellite imagery differ? These are just a few suggestions - let us know if you have more. We’re also looking for funding opportunities. You can get in touch with us via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5-LIScH0URlymhTzXAyrbTJUEMmfBvWfBVuW38Zw9PnxPzA/viewform&quot;&gt;feedback form&lt;/a&gt; (also accessible from the app).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I for one am going to keep swiping - as well as being relaxing and quite addictive as a process it really does make a difference on the ground. I’ve always liked the MapSwipe icon of a person waving as though saying “here I am, please put me on the map”. By putting on the map people like the women and girls who might need the services of Pran Men’m we can help make sure they get the help they need when they need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nell added “I’d also add a huge thank you to all the MapSwipers. The team in the field didn’t realise that MapSwipe was an option. I was explaining it to them and they were just blown away that people were giving their time and energy to help the project and were even more blown away by the fact that it was super quick and effective. It was really hugely appreciated.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess Cahill</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="MapSwipe" /><category term="Haiti" /><category term="volunteering" /><summary type="html">MapSwipe volunteer Jess Cahill looks at current MapSwipe developments and how the crowdmapping app is helping survivors of sexual violence in Haiti.</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">4 weeks in Madagascar with OSM-Mada &amp;amp; PHF/PHM - Disaster Risk Reduction project</title><link href="/blog/2018/04/24/madagascar-field-mapping/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="4 weeks in Madagascar with OSM-Mada &amp; PHF/PHM - Disaster Risk Reduction project" /><published>2018-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/blog/2018/04/24/madagascar-field-mapping</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2018/04/24/madagascar-field-mapping/">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a new natural Disaster Risk Reduction project launched in partnership with the French NGO Pompiers Humanitaires Français (PHF) and the local OpenStreetMap community, Missing Maps’ member CartONG implemented a 4-week mission in Madagascar in March 2018. The objectives: raising awareness on data sharing, collecting data in the field and producing maps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;long-standing-ties-with-madagascar&quot;&gt;Long-standing ties with Madagascar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For several years, CartONG has developed and maintained friendly relations with Madagascar. Our Missing Maps coordinator, Violaine Doutreleau, a then-volunteer, had organized a training in the island back in July 2015 which helped launch and structure the Malagasy OpenStreetMap community. This first training was then followed by 2 other deployments in 2016 and 2017: the first one linked to the project of Madagascar Solidarity Atlas and the second one developed to provide webmapping support to CNLS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;launch-of-a-disaster-risk-reduction-project-with-phf&quot;&gt;Launch of a Disaster Risk Reduction Project with PHF&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20180424_workgroup1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, we started a new project in partnership with the NGO Pompiers Humanitaires Français (PHF) – French Humanitarian Firefighters, which has been operating in eastern Madagascar (Atsinanana region) since 2010. In particular, PHF initiated the creation of an emergency and civil protection centre in Vatomandry in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malagasy volunteer firefighters currently work on prevention (tree cutting, etc.), awareness-raising (first aid exercises and trainings, etc.), and assistance and reconstruction in the district’s capital. They are regularly called to intervene on the whole district but have not had so far the capacity to deploy in rural areas, for lack of being able to plan their interventions outside of urban areas despite having the equipment to do so (SUV). The goal of this new project was thus to improve the firefighters’ ability to respond by providing them with maps which would allow them to define their intervention areas and to deploy more easily when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, we organized several Missing Maps mapathons between October 2017 and February 2018 in order to prepare for the OSM base map needed for the mission. As a result, a total of 60 000 buildings and 3000 kilometers of roads and pathways were either added or updated on OSM – all data were then validated by CartONG volunteers. We would like to take this opportunity to thank Airbus for providing us with the necessary satellite imagery for the mapathons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-weeks-in-the-field&quot;&gt;4 weeks in the field&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20180424_workgroup2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This preparatory phase led to a mission in Madagascar organized from March 3rd to 27th 2018, thanks to the decisive support of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnes.fr/en&quot;&gt;CNES&lt;/a&gt; (the French Space Agency). After a preliminary phase in Antananarivo with the Malagasy OSM community – during which a data sharing workshop, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cartong.org/activity/building-data-collaborative-support-sdgs-health-and-wash-malawi-and-drc&quot;&gt;the one organized in January 2018 in the DRC&lt;/a&gt;, was organized – the combined CartONG &amp;amp; OSM-Mg team then left for the Atsinanana region to collect data in the field for 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission was disrupted by the passage of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/assocCartONG/status/975740284284882944&quot;&gt;tropical storm Eliakim&lt;/a&gt; and the resulting lack of accessibility of most rural areas as bridges were damaged or destroyed. The team nonetheless managed to collect most of the data required for the proper implementation of the project. Maps are now being produced for PHF / PHM (their local partner). Additionally, we are pleased to have been able to raise awareness among local stakeholders such as the NGO Care International and the head of the topographic department of the Vatomandry district. Lastly, we managed to obtain local administrative information (such as administrative boundaries) which will be integrated into OSM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-mission-offering-a-wealth-of-learning-opportunities&quot;&gt;A mission offering a wealth of learning opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/missingmaps-blog_20180424_fieldwork.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mission was a rich human and technical experience. It was also one of the first missions organized in full autonomy by CartONG, that is to say without the support of an international NGO in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this mission, we once again noted the considerable lack of data collection tools for NGOs and public authorities operating in the field and of their general ignorance regarding OpenStreetMap and existing open-source cartographic data. In order to remedy this situation, we uploaded the OSMAnd application on the smartphones of as many local actors as possible during the mission. We also extensively shared the toolbox &lt;a href=&quot;http://cartong.org/news/icts-and-small-aid-organisations-publication-study-and-toolbox&quot;&gt;produced in partnership with the Agence des Micro Projets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now hope to launch the second phase of the project in order to go deeper in the use of the data produced by local actors, both for disaster risk reduction purposes and for the implementation of other development projects. We also intend to continue supporting and collaborating with the Malagasy OSM community in order to provide mapping and information management tools adapted to the needs of field workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cartong.org/fr/contact-us&quot;&gt;get in touch with CartONG&lt;/a&gt; if you know of any organization working in Madagascar which might be interested in maps &amp;amp; open data!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Martin Noblecourt</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="field mapping" /><category term="project update" /><summary type="html">As part of a new natural Disaster Risk Reduction project launched in partnership with the French NGO Pompiers Humanitaires Français (PHF) and the local OpenStreetMap community, Missing Maps member CartONG implemented a 4-week mission in Madagascar in March 2018.

&lt;p&gt;Eight years after the devastating earthquake in January 2010, the landscape in Haiti is still in flux and continuously changing. For organizations working in Haiti, recovery programs slowly transition to preparedness and disaster risk reduction. More importantly, for over 250,000 people north of Port-au-Prince a patch of land that was once a blank slate transitions into a future. The resourcefulness of this community has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redcross.org/news/article/In-Canaan-Haiti-residents-guide-the-citys-development&quot;&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2014, the American Red Cross has been supporting residents of this community through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redcross.org/news/article/Haiti-Canaan-residents-join-together-to-overcome-economic-challenges&quot;&gt;health, infrastructure, and livelihoods programs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Approach to Canaan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canaan lies in rolling foothills about 10km north of Port-au-Prince. The population has continuously grown since the earthquake and dense urban areas have developed in central parts. The farther areas are more sparsely populated although this is rapidly changing as can be seen in the amount of ongoing construction. Canaan has grown so rapidly that keeping a map of the area up to date is extremely difficult. Additionally, some communities have become so dense that the satellite imagery commonly used to create maps is not detailed enough to accurately interpret. To address these issues and benefit the communities and other organizations working there, the American Red Cross collected, processed, and made available high resolution, up-to-date, drone imagery for the entire 35 square kilometer area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To collect imagery of Canaan we utilized DJI’s Mavic Pro quadcopter. Flight planning was done with the DroneDeploy app. We could define an area of interest, set a flight altitude, and set desired overlap between images. Higher overlap means the images can be more accurately stitched together but will increase mission time and, later, the processing time as well due to the higher number of images that need to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DroneDeploy automatically calculates the number of flights passes over the area of interest and the distance between passes. The app also allows a mission to be resumed after switching out the Mavic’s battery for areas that cannot be completed during the approximately 25 minutes of flight time possible on a single battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the Mavic Pro’s size and sensor capabilities, it took a large number of flights with close together passes. In preparation, we packed 20 batteries and power converters that let us charge batteries in our vehicle while flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve accuracy of our orthomosaic, at each launch point, ground control points (GCPs) were used. GPS coordinates are taken at the center of the GCP and when the orthomosaic is created, it can be georectified by adjusting the latitude and longitude of the GCP in the image to match those of the collected coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Ground control point placed near launch site, CC-BY American Red Cross&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, for an area as large as Canaan we would be able to use a fixed wing drone. We’ve used a platform called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuffwing.com/&quot;&gt;Tuffwing UAV Mapper&lt;/a&gt;. It has a longer flight time and a camera sensor with a larger field of view allowing for more area to be covered by a single picture. Unfortunately, using the Tuffwing in Canaan was mostly not feasible due to factors like high winds and trouble finding large enough, clear landing areas. We were able to fly the Tuffwing to capture imagery in only one neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flight-planning&quot;&gt;Flight Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best laid plans of mice and men, go oft awry&lt;/em&gt; - Robert Burns, paraphrased&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing to plan is planning to fail, so based on what we knew of the Canaan area and the capabilities of the drones we created flight plans and a schedule roughly based on a grid of 1km squares. It was easy to set up what appeared to be a flawless plan from 1,400 miles away; however, perhaps not surprisingly, our plan needed to be adjusted throughout our time in Haiti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using drones for humanitarian purposes, an important aspect of the process is community sensitization and buy-in. From other Red Cross work in Canaan there is a fantastic network of community focal points. These community members work with their neighbors and community leaders and facilitate effective communication and cooperation for Red Cross projects in the neighborhood. Red Cross staff worked with the focal points to explain ahead of time the goal of the drone flights and to address any concerns. More information about best practices when using drones in humanitarian contexts can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uavcode.org/&quot;&gt;UAViators website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some neighborhoods, these conversations were completed faster than others. Because of this, our initial itinerary changed very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had a better idea of the timeline for which we would be able to fly over certain communities, we worked out a more efficient plan for selecting flight locations. Using our initial grid as guidance, we used an ASTER DEM to identify centrally located high points in the landscape. Using these points, we calculated Voronoi Polygons to have a better idea of reachable areas from a given launch point. We would then edit these polygons to create more “reasonable” (totally subjective) areas for a given flight. We didn’t want too many very small areas, as travel time would ultimately take away from flying time. We preferred to send the drone a bit further rather than pack up, travel, and unpack to do a short flight. Ultimately we made judgement calls based on the topography. We created overlap with neighboring flight areas as well as areas between assigned days. The overlap would ensure coverage of a given location in case the direction of the flights varied slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polygons of the flight areas were converted to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.kml&lt;/code&gt; files and uploaded to the DroneDeploy website. Most flight altitudes were set to 160 meters with 70% side-lap and 80% front-lap. With no UAS regulation in Haiti at the time, almost no air traffic in the area, and very clear lines of sight, we were able to fly at this altitude consistently throughout our mission. After selecting the flight direction (which could be edited upon arrival at the flight location to adjust for wind), the flight plans could then be synced to the DroneDeploy iPad app, which connects to the Mavic Pro flight controller and is used to program the drone for its flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flying&quot;&gt;Flying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre-identified launch points were converted to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gpx&lt;/code&gt; waypoints and added to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://osmand.net/&quot;&gt;OsmAnd&lt;/a&gt; mobile app on our phones.  We could then use the app to navigate to our destinations via the previously traced OSM road network. In most neighborhoods we would travel with the community focal point, and use their knowledge to navigate more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we were setting up at a launch point, the community focal point would work with us to explain to and demonstrate for onlooking community members, the work that we were doing with the drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to flights, we used two Sony Action Cameras to capture street level imagery as we drove throughout Canaan. The imagery of the area can be viewed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat=18.652149722222248&amp;amp;lng=-72.29545138888886&amp;amp;z=17&amp;amp;pKey=qesHt-3rIoVgYZaYtguNsQ&amp;amp;focus=photo&quot;&gt;Mapillary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://openstreetcam.com/details/990741/207&quot;&gt;OpenStreetCam&lt;/a&gt;. Both forward facing and side facing images were captured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://embed-v1.mapillary.com/embed?version=1&amp;amp;filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&amp;amp;map_filter=%5B%22all%22%5D&amp;amp;map_style=mapbox_streets&amp;amp;image_key=qesHt-3rIoVgYZaYtguNsQ&amp;amp;x=0.5&amp;amp;y=0.5&amp;amp;client_id=MFpjMU5abGRUMmxoQjEzdUNUMFRjdzo3NmEwODNjYzdkNGQ5OWE5&amp;amp;style=split&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 6 days of flying (with excessive wind grounding us for 2 additional days), we launched and landed the Mavics enough times to collect 28,232 nadir (downward-facing) images. While driving between launch sites we collected 133,109 street level images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;processing&quot;&gt;Processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the American Red Cross, we support the development and use of open source software. We are fans of the OpenDroneMap project. Due to the magnitude of images that were collected, we processed the images in 66 separate groups, each less 1000 images, making sure that there was significant overlap of these areas for continuity when later merging them. It took several attempts and and multiple methodologies to identify a process that resulted in a quality orthoimage to be shared. Things that could go wrong, did: hard drives filled up, uploads failed, GDAL installations were messed up, downloads failed, and more. OpenDroneMap has since been improved to better handle such large image sets, so it’ll be a lot easier next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the merged orthomosaic was complete, we adjusted the georeferencing of the mosaic using the ground control points that had been laid out at each launch site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The orthomosaic has been added to and can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;https://map.openaerialmap.org/#/-72.27829399999999,18.670043999999997,10/user/59ecfc8c31eff4000c3804dd/5ac7d6ca91b5310010e0d4c4?_k=a7m179&quot;&gt;OpenAerialMap&lt;/a&gt;. New mapping projects have been created on the HOT Tasking manager. Due to the density of the area and presence of existing data, these projects are available to advanced mappers only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imagery has been shared with American Red Cross staff as well as partners and organizations working in Canaan to improve population estimates, plan DRR activities, and assist with community planning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matthew Gibb and Dan Joseph</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Haiti" /><category term="Canaan" /><category term="drones" /><category term="OpenDroneMap" /><summary type="html">Canaan, one of the most populated areas in Haiti, continues to evolve and grow.

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.missingmaps.org/&quot;&gt;Missing Maps&lt;/a&gt; started, it was impossible to imagine what it would ultimately become. The goal was to simply make more open map data available before disasters and to help the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team build more local mapping communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on we realized we needed better ways to quantify and track the impact of Missing Maps to OSM. Nearly 4 years later, we are making great progress on both of those fronts. Our efforts eventually produced the Missing Maps &lt;a href=&quot;https://missingmaps.org/leaderboards&quot;&gt;leaderboards&lt;/a&gt;, which sought to track individual users and teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Missing Maps leaderboard technology is a streaming, real-time look at who is supporting our work. Initially funded by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/csr/impact/cisco-foundation.html&quot;&gt;Cisco Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the leaderboards became a major way to engage and reward mappers. We were blown away when 4,000 mappers helped out on Missing Maps projects during the first year. Four years later, 52,000 mappers contributed to 1,200 mapping Missing Maps projects, the vast majority of those mappers were making their very first edits to OSM. In 2017, 10% of all new OSM mappers made their first edits in support of Missing Maps. The scale of tracking all these new users created problems for our system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a generous grant from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/philanthropies/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Philanthropies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pacatlas.com/&quot;&gt;Pacific Atlas&lt;/a&gt; migrated the stack to Microsoft Azure, completed a full analysis backfill, and rewrote large chunks to enable things to scale better in the future without dropping edits. As always, all the code is open, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/missingmaps&quot;&gt;leaderboard code&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/americanredcross/osm-stats&quot;&gt;osm-stats&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure. We are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/missingmaps/missingmaps.github.io/issues&quot;&gt;always looking for help&lt;/a&gt; to create new badges or suggest new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Contributors&lt;/strong&gt;: We did a complete backfill of OSM history using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/azavea/osmesa&quot;&gt;OSMesa&lt;/a&gt; to capture dropped edits and editors (and to update our calculations). You’ll notice that our number of total contributors is well over 52,000 now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Edits&lt;/strong&gt;: The total number of edits has increased.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Edits&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a big change. In the past we we tracked &lt;em&gt;Buildings Added&lt;/em&gt; to OSM. After doing some reflection, this wasn’t a good representation of the total volume of edits Missing Maps contributes. Building Edits now reflects &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; new additions and the contributions of our validators to clean up and coach new mappers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Road Measurements&lt;/strong&gt;: We’ve got some egg on our face here. We fixed some math errors (briefly: edits were counting the full length) and we are now &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt; reporting the total km of roads added and edited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/arcmaps/share/blog-pictures/mm_stats_new.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Missing Maps Stats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s New&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Data&lt;/strong&gt;: We now have data for &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; changesets (previously we’d only been tracking &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#hashtagged&lt;/code&gt; ones). This means that user profile pages now include &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; edits made, rather than only those associated with hashtags. Users can still find their contribution to an individual hashtag by searching for the hashtag and user name in the leaderboards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More POIs&lt;/strong&gt;: Edits with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;amenity=*&lt;/code&gt; were previously the only POIs accounted for; we’ve expanded the set of tags tracked to better match Missing Maps editing activity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Leaders&lt;/strong&gt;: With the new data we’ve got some new leaders. I’m totally amazed at the commitment and dedication of Missing Maps mappers. From the first-time mapathon volunteer who manages to complete 40 buildings to the repeat mappers who make literally hundreds of thousands of edits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Map&lt;/strong&gt;: We changed the way the user contribution map is showing. Instead of a heatmap, we now display a simple choropleth that breaks down contributions by country.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badges&lt;/strong&gt;: We dropped support for the GPS Tracks Badge. We weren’t seeing a big uptick in new tracks added to OSM and this is already supported on the OSM user profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slightly less real-time&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to the increased volume of data that we’re tracking, we had to reduce the aggregation frequency in order to keep things sprightly. Expect data to update approximately every 10-15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSM Stats API&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/osm-stats/blob/master/documentation/API.md&quot;&gt;OSM Stats API&lt;/a&gt; now supports some additional queries and options, not all of which are documented yet but will be in the coming days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSM Stats Workers&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/osm-stats-workers&quot;&gt;OSM Stats Workers&lt;/a&gt; was almost completely rewritten; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/osm-stats-workers/tree/master/src/metrics&quot;&gt;metric calculations&lt;/a&gt; have been simplified and stream handling made more robust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Red Cross is very excited to announce a USD $25,000 grant to OpenStreetMap Foundation for a hardware purchase to support the ongoing resilience of the OSM infrastructure. The funds were allocated towards the purchase and provisioning of a ‘hot’ backup database failover server – which has been purchased and is currently humming along doing its important job! This trail-blazing contribution will ensure that we can recover from site failures quickly and with the minimum amount of disruption for those editing the map. This is a big step forward in platform resiliency that we otherwise would not have been able to make at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Red Cross and OpenStreetMap&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Red Cross has steadily ramped up our support for OpenStreetMap since our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redcross.org/news/article/New-Mapping-Technologies-for-the-Developing-World&quot;&gt;first mapathon in to map communities in Uganda in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. Identifying OSM as a source of up-to-date map data crucial to their international disaster field operations, we’ve quickly developed into a major contributor to OSM and support of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). Most recently through the Missing Maps initiative, to which around 10% of all OSM map contributions can now be attributed. The American Red Cross also supports OpenStreetMap through &lt;a href=&quot;http://posm.io&quot;&gt;app development&lt;/a&gt; and sponsorship of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sotm.us&quot;&gt;State of the Map&lt;/a&gt; conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Mappers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your incredible efforts organizing this year’s OSM GeoWeek! In total, we had 230 public events in 48 countries. We had almost 100 extra events this year and increased our country footprint by 6 countries. Together, we added 292,856 features, which is about double what we accomplished in 2016.  What amazing accomplishments! One of my favorite quotes comes from Geneva, where a participant checked in with her event organizer to let her know that she found that “Mapping was mesmerizing and relaxing” and had spent that next weekend practicing her new skill!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would love to hear about your event to help make next year even bigger and better. If you have time, please fill out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKG9bYHIcPdHSnT3Yf700LC0evzCqs-ihI5rkjaAopdcCMOg/viewform&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; to let us know what went well, what went poorly, and if you have any lessons you’d like to pass on to your fellow organizers. If you would like to share pictures, please add them with a short blurb to HOT’s Flickr located &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/groups/hotosm/pool/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, from all of us on the OSM GeoWeek organizing team, thank you so much for your planning, mapping, and continued support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,

&lt;p&gt;A year ago marked the end of the West Africa mapping project, where over 100 Red Cross volunteers in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone traveled to over 7,000 border communities to ensure that these vulnerable areas were “on the map” - creating open data in OpenStreetMap that can be used by responders if another epidemic like Ebola were to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Red Cross project has wrapped up, the OSM communities are growing in all three countries, and we’re excited to share updates about their activities and what they are planning for Geography Awareness Week this month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to the OSM communities in these countries and especially to those who shared their updates for this post: Youssef Bamba, Tommy Godphery, Emmanuel Greene, David Luswata, Patrick Massaquoi, Emmanuel Myers, O’George Stephens, and Tino Toupane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;guinea&quot;&gt;Guinea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSM Guinea has grown to a big community of 233 members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the West Africa Mapping Project, the OSM community of Guinea organized 10 mapathons to focus on mapping in Conakry. OSM Guinea has also fully mapped the city of Dalaba in collaboration with a local Youth Mappers chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community also helped with mapping activities farther afield - helping to map in response to Hurricane Irma, the recent earthquake in Mexico, the Freetown landslides, World Malaria Day, and ongoing malaria activities in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these contributions, OSM Guinea helped to create three Youth Mappers chapters in Guinea and one chapter at Fourah Bay College in Freetown. The community has also trained 73 students in mapping with QGIS and another 65 people in OSM editing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For GeoWeek 2017, OSM Guinea has planned four mapathons in partnership with the Youth Mappers chapters of the universities of Dalaba, Sonfonia and N’Wéréloré.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future activities, OSM Guinea is interested to map the rest of the city of Conakry and to start Youth Mappers chapters at Kankan University and Boke University. They are also looking for partners to support infrastructure and services mapping for Conakry, mapping of the Mount Nimba Biosphere Reserve, and computer upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;liberia&quot;&gt;Liberia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSM Liberia has also been growing quickly, and recently reached 425 members. This includes the Liberia chapter of Youth Mappers, which is active in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, OSM Liberia was actively involved in a HOT project that trained and enabled volunteers to map their respective communities, roads, administrative boundaries, and other amenities in three cities of three counties in Liberia; Bong, Nimba and Grand Gedeh Counties. The volunteers were also involved with data cleaning and editing processes under the supervision of the HOT team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For GeoWeek this year, OSM Liberia is working on bringing all of its cells from all regions of the country to host a grand mapathon event. This event will encompass diverse mapping activities which will last for a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSM Liberia is also looking for new partners for activities for the upcoming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sierra-leone&quot;&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sierra Leone OSM community is relatively new, but has had an exciting year. Fourah Bay College in Freetown launched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthmappers.org/&quot;&gt;Youth Mapper Chapter&lt;/a&gt; and the FBC students have continued to participate in mapping activities. Outside of Youth Mappers, the OSM Sierra Leone community has been growing and was represented at State of the Map Africa by Grace Kainessi and State of the Map Asia by Tommy Charles. This OSM community is working towards formal recognition as an independent organization and intends to file for legal registration with the government. Congrats to the OSM SL community for this exciting step!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Luswata, Emily Eros, and local contributors</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="geoweek" /><summary type="html">Mapping in West Africa continues, thanks to dedicated OSM communities in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone.

&lt;p&gt;One of the exciting things about working with Red Cross mapping projects is that we endeavor to build the capacity of the community so that they can plan and lead field projects for themselves. The American Red Cross GIS team sometimes trains mappers ourselves, but we are excited to move more and more towards a model of empowering the local Red Cross and other institutions so that they understand the tools available for mapping, the process for designing fieldwork, and the workflow for cleaning and uploading data and conducting analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the spring and summer, we led trainings in Jamaica and Belize that were intended to raise the capacity of local staff and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Belize, for example, we led a workshop with 18 participants from agencies with expertise in social services and emergency response, fire response, youth and MARP communities, mapping apps creator, and the national spatial data management division. Participants gained familiarity and skills for the main aspects of the Missing Maps approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remote mapping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data collection in the field&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding the ways the data can be used for decision-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Workshop participants in Belize, CC-BY American Red Cross&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants appreciated learning about different ways to collect information and the accessibility. These included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practical sessions which included going into the community and linking drawings to the satellite images by first starting with field papers by tagging with &lt;a href=&quot;www.openmapkit.org&quot;&gt;OMK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exposure and tutorials on various open source applications (websites) and design and used for apps (&lt;a href=&quot;https://opendatakit.org/&quot;&gt;ODK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;www.openmapkit.org&quot;&gt;OMK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://osmand.net/&quot;&gt;OsmAnd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;www.posm.io&quot;&gt;POSM&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussion and brainstorming of potential uses for other aspects of regional NS preparedness work (eg. VCAs) and emergency management in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trainings took place both in the classroom and during field mapping practice in Belize City and Gungulung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By participating in this workshop, participants improved their technical skills and also built stronger relationships with one another, which will hopefully enable productive conversations, support, and possibilities over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ashley Schmeltzer</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="POSM" /><summary type="html">This spring and summer, the American Red Cross led training-of-trainers in Belize and Jamaica to build the mapping skills and knowledge of local Red Cross and government staff - here's a quick update of our work.</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">IFRC joins Missing Maps</title><link href="/blog/2017/09/13/ifrc/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="IFRC joins Missing Maps" /><published>2017-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/blog/2017/09/13/ifrc</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2017/09/13/ifrc/">&lt;p&gt;We are excited to welcome the newest member of the Missing Maps partnership: the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). For those who aren’t familiar, in informal terms, the IFRC is the umbrella organization that encompasses independent national Red Cross societies in 190 countries and helps to coordinate and support these national societies. This is a cross-post from the IFRC’s official announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-maps-is-building-trust&quot;&gt;Building Maps is Building Trust&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifrc.org/&quot;&gt;International Federation of the Red Cross Red Crescent Societies&lt;/a&gt; is joining the Missing Maps Partnership. Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project in which you can help to map areas where humanitarian organisations are trying to meet the needs of vulnerable people – creating open data that can be used for planning, awareness, and analysis. Over 33,000 people have contributed 33 million edits to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; since Missing Maps was founded in 2014. These contributions have been used to support health interventions, emergency response, and resilience programs. Volunteers, organizations, and humanitarians collaborate in a number of ways: remote mapping, field mapping, and humanitarian activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded by the American Red Cross, British Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, Missing Maps connects a global community of volunteers to humanitarian response. Other Movement members also include the Netherlands Red Cross and the Canadian Red Cross.  Some of the mapathon activities initiatives include mapping tasks in support of work of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icrc.org/&quot;&gt;International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrcs.org/&quot;&gt;Nepal Red Cross Society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trcs.or.tz/&quot;&gt;Tanzania Red Cross Society&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/where-we-work/africa/malawi-red-cross-society/&quot;&gt;Malawi Red Cross Society&lt;/a&gt;. Mapathons have been hosted by many national societies including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcross.fi/&quot;&gt;Finnish Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drk.de/en/&quot;&gt;German Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.croix-rouge.lu/en/&quot;&gt;Luxembourg Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;. As we grow this program, we anticipate more collaboration across the Movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to mapathons and remote activities, Missing Maps often involves field mapping with local Red Cross volunteers to add additional detail and context to the map. Previous field mapping activities (led by the American Red Cross) have supported measles vaccination monitoring in Malawi, the construction of a water pipeline in Zimbabwe, the identification of vulnerable border communities as part of Ebola recovery in West Africa, and the installation of fire sensors in an informal settlement in South Africa… to name a few. The scope of these projects varies from community-level mapping to larger-scale initiatives; in West Africa, volunteers visited 7,000 villages to collect information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Building Maps is building trust,” IFRC Under Secretary General, Jemilah Mahmood. Engaging local communities and volunteers with Missing Maps provides an opportunity to link our work to more volunteers, including youth and as well as technical audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first IFRC Missing Maps projects to be launched is pandemic preparedness partnership between IFRC Public Health Unit and the American Red Cross. The teams identified 9 countries where we will be taking a nationwide approach for nationwide data layers. We will likely create Missing Maps tasks for areas identified as vulnerable. This project drives at the core of the Missing Maps mission of creating open data for areas where humanitarian organisations are trying to meet the needs of vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are active mapping tasks mapping tasks focused on current humanitarian needs. This includes response for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotosm.org/updates/2017-09-09_hot_activates_for_three_disasters_hurricane_irma_mexico_earthquake_bangladesh&quot;&gt;Hurricane Irma, the Mexico earthquake and Bangladesh floods&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteering is at the heart of all that the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement activities. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nos.nl/op3/artikel/2191845-daniel-24-verleent-hulp-op-sint-maarten-vanuit-zijn-slaapkamer.html&quot;&gt;Hear one volunteer’s story on mapping for the Sint Maarten Hurricane Irma response.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;missing-maps-partnership-and-ifrc&quot;&gt;Missing Maps Partnership and IFRC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Missing Maps Partnership mission and goals directly align with our goals at IFRC.  This follows our path of “learn by doing” for data literacy skills.  As part of the Agenda for Humanity (Grand Bargain), the Missing Maps Partnership provides a concrete example of participatory engagement (local and global) by creating and sharing open data for humanitarian preparedness and response.  IFRC will facilitate the growth of Missing Maps activities in collaboration with the founding members and members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IFRC’s contributions as a partner are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;National Society Engagement: Support and advocate National Society engagement for Missing Maps activities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve Data Literacy:  Encourage Missing Maps projects as potential teaching mechanism for data literacy/data skills across the IFRC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mapping: Host mapathons and promote Mapping (remotely and locally).  Support for mapping activities (advice and tech support)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage Youth Engagement: Volunteering is at the core of the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement’s humanitarian efforts. There is a large potential to support volunteer, especially youth, engagement in the Missing Maps project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We excited to be collaborating with all the Missing Maps Partners and the wider OpenStreetMap community. Stay tuned for more activities.
